# Facial-Recognition-DL

The purpose of this study is to compare the performance of several SOTA convolutional neural networks on the task of facial recognition when trained on a small dataset. These models are available at https://keras.io/api/applications/. 

The models were built using transfer learning; a standard classifier was attached to the output of each SOTA model and trained accordingly.

The dataset for this study was comprised of personal images of my friends. This is a small dataset as there were only ~100 images per class for training.

Results were stored in a text file and a wrote a report analyzing the training and testing data.
